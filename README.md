#
# Usage
## Infection Probability
- The Infection Probability value determines how likely a healthy individual is to get infected upon contact with an infected one.
- Adjust the Infection Probability slider to the desired value, the default is 0.2.
- Only new individuals will be created with the selected value, previously created individuals are not affected when changing the slider vaslue.
- Meaning each individual keeps its own infection probability throughout the simulation.
## Adding or Removing Individuals 
- Press the +1 Healthy button to add a new healthy individual to the simulation.
- Press the +1 Infected button to add a new infected individual to the simulation.
- Press the Reset button to remove all individuals and reset the simulation parameters.
#
# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or greater
